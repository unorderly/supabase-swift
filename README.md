Supabase client for swift. Mirrors the design of [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/blob/master/README.md).

* Documentation: [https://supabase.com/docs/reference/swift/introduction](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/swift/introduction)

## Usage

Install the library using the Swift Package Manager.

```swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-swift.git",
            from: "2.0.0"
        ),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourTargetName",
            dependencies: ["Supabase"] // Add as a dependency
        )
    ]
)
```

If you're using Xcode, [use this guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) to add `supabase-swift` to your project. Use `https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-swift.git` for the url when Xcode asks.

If you don't want the full Supabase environment, you can also add individual packages, such as `Functions`, `Auth`, `Realtime`, `Storage`, or `PostgREST`.

Then you're able to import the package and establish the connection with the database.

```swift
/// Create a single supabase client for interacting with your database
let client = SupabaseClient(supabaseURL: URL(string: "https://xyzcompany.supabase.co")!, supabaseKey: "public-anon-key")
```

### Initialize with custom options

```swift
let client = SupabaseClient(
    supabaseURL: URL(string: "https://xyzcompany.supabase.co")!, 
    supabaseKey: "public-anon-key",
    options: SupabaseClientOptions(
        db: .init(
            schema: "public"
        ),
        auth: .init(
            storage: MyCustomLocalStorage(),
            flowType: .pkce
        ),
        global: .init(
            headers: ["x-my-custom-header": "my-app-name"],
            session: URLSession.myCustomSession
        )
    )
)
```
